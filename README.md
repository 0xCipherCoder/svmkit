# Zuma

Zuma is a specialized Debian-based OS distribution tailored to run Solana validator and RPC clients, including Anza and Firedancer. Designed for flexibility and robustness, Zuma is optimized to deploy Solana nodes across bare metal servers, virtual machines, and containerized environments.

Our goal is to drastically lower the expertise needed to deploy and manage Solana nodes and to develop community-tested configuration setups for Solana. The initial target is to support validators, but the end goal is to provide a complete installation and management solution for running both permissioned and permissionless Solana clusters, with mechanisms to easily bridge between them.

## Mission

*ABK Labs* is on a mission to leverage open-source software and blockchain technology to drive freedom and self-sovereignty on a global scale. Our aim is to democratize access to powerful blockchain technology by making it easier to build, launch, and maintain Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) forks. By simplifying the process and reducing barriers, we believe we can spark a significant increase in SVM adoption, mirroring the explosion seen with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.
